# Ruffini method automatized

## Why?

This code is for a computional math in the college, because of it's in C and not C++ ;-;-;-;-;-;
given any polynomial expression exists a binom x - a that divides it, this code automate the procces.


## Compiler 
I'm using GCC compiler in the restrict mode to prevent error compilation bash code:

```bash
gcc -Wall ruffini.c -o any
```
